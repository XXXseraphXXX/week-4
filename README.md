# week-4 Types and Ml tutorial by Jimmy Zhang
## introduction to types
A type is a Set of value 
in the variable n we can see that x is a varible of type int and that in-tails that n can take on any value from tne set of all integer values.

the following types that are most commonly use: float, double, char, etc
there are different kind of types like primitive type and constructed type
primitive type is a type of a programmer can use but not define
Constructed type is a user defined type

### Supertype and Subset
A supertype is a subtype of an elements of a type 
what does that mean so in a language like c++ byte is a subtype of int 
we can observe:
- converting a value of a subtype to a values of the super-type is
called widening type conversion. (safe)

- converting a value of a supertype to a value of a subtype is
called narrowing type conversion. (not safe)

### Function type 
-Functions can be passed as values; just as values that belong to other data types
-Functions belong to function types
so in ml we can consider the function type real â†’ int
This type represents the set of all functions from real to int
other member of this type would be :

Why do we use types?
types help computer languages system to assist the dev write better program 
type mismatches indicate some sort of programming error.
**Static checking:** type checking done at compile time

**Dynamic checking:** type checking done at run time

### Type Equivalence 
**Structural equivalence:** Names are replaced by the type expressions they define. If the resulting type expressions have the same structure, they are equivalent.
**Name equivalence:** Names are not replaced by the type expressions they define. Two expressions are equivalent if and only if they are structurally equivalent without name substitution.
